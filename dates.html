    <p>
        On this date, the operation of the blue line from Rosemont to O'Hare Airport was shut down 
        for a period of nine days and the line started again on October 7 this can be seen in the graph

    <p>
        November 28th is Thanksgiving and it is followed by black Friday. For this date, I wanted 
        to see if the number of people going to O'Hare Airport would increase or not as it was a 
        long weekend. As we can see from the data after November 22nd we can see there is an 
        increasing trend and then the number of entries was lowest on Thanksgiving.

        storm that affected large swaths of the United States and Canada from January 31 to

    <h3>December 25th 2019</h3>
    <p>
        For this date which is Christmas I wanted to see if there was an increase in the number 
        of people travelling as it was holiday season. So the graph was constructed using O'Hare 
        data and as we can see after 25th there was an increase in travel as holidays start.

    <h3>September 11th 2001</h3>
    <p>
        The September 11 attacks, also commonly referred to as 9/11,a were a series of four 
        coordinated terrorist attacks by the militant Islamist terrorist group 
        al-Qaeda against the United States. So I wanted to see if this effected the people 
        travelling to O'Hare Airport. Looking at the graph we can see that at 12th the number of 
        entries was the lowest and from then on there was a slow upward trend.
