    <h3>About Data</h3>
    <p>
        The data is collected by Chicago Transit Authority we can export the data from this 
        https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f site </a>.
        The data contains different fields like stationId, stationname, date, daytype and rides. 
        The data is collected from the year 2000 to 2021, rides in the data represent  
        the count of passengers who has used CTA for transport and stationname represents the 
        station on which the customer has on board. So a ride is counted only when a person
        tries to board a train or a bus. Daytype takes three values where W is Weekday, A means
        Saturday and U means Sunday or a Holiday.

    <h3>How to reproduce this project</h3>
    <p> 
        Here is a link to the github repository which has the required files to run this project
        https://github.com/abhi2596/VVAProject1.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two options to download this code from this repository one is cloning the project
        using github for this we need to have git installed on your desktop and the other is just 
        downloading the files.
        Both of these options are available in code dropdown. We will discuss the 
        latter approach which is  
        downloading the files, To download under code select download zip and extract the files then open
        R studio, R studio needs to be installed on your desktop to run this project. To run this 
        project we need to install some packages in R to install a package the command in R is 
        install.package("packagename"). For this project we need to install packages shiny,shiny dashboard,
        ggplot, lubridate, gridExtra, scales, dplyr, DT. Once this packages are installed 
        open app.R in R Studio it contains the code required to run this application. 
        In R studio press run app this will launch the application in your local web browser.
